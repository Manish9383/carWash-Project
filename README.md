## Aquawash – On-Demand Car Wash 🚗💧

## Overview

**Aquawash** is a full-stack, microservices-based on-demand car wash platform that connects customers with professional car washers at their preferred location. Users can book instant or scheduled car wash services, choose packages and add-ons, make secure payments, and provide reviews and ratings. The system is designed for scalability, reliability, and a seamless user experience, targeting the **USA market**.

The application follows modern **microservices architecture** principles using Spring Boot on the backend and Angular on the frontend, with event-driven communication and cloud-ready deployments.

---

## Architecture

* **Backend:** Spring Boot Microservices (REST/JSON APIs)
* **Frontend:** Angular (responsive web UI)
* **Databases:** MySQL / MongoDB / H2 (per-service database)
* **Messaging:** RabbitMQ (asynchronous events & notifications)
* **Security:** JWT-based authentication & role-based authorization
* **Payments:** Braintree Payment Gateway
* **Deployment:** Docker & Kubernetes (containerized and scalable)

Each microservice is independently deployable and owns its own data store, following best practices such as centralized logging, exception handling, testing, and build automation.
