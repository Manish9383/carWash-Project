# Car Wash Application - 4 Minute Technical Demo Script

## **TIMING: 0:00 - 0:30 (30 seconds) - Introduction & Architecture Overview**

### **What to Show:**
- IDE with project structure open
- Architecture diagram (if available) or draw simple microservices diagram

### **What to Say:**
"Welcome to my comprehensive Car Wash Application built using microservices architecture. This is a full-stack enterprise application with Angular frontend and Spring Boot backend consisting of 6 microservices: User Service, Booking Service, Payment Service, Review Service, Notification Service, and Car Service - all orchestrated through an API Gateway with Eureka Server for service discovery. The application supports three user roles: Customers, Washers, and Admins, with real-time notifications and secure JWT authentication."

### **Technical Points to Highlight:**
- Microservices architecture with Spring Cloud Gateway
- Angular 17+ frontend with TypeScript
- MySQL for transactional data, MongoDB for notifications
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Real-time WebSocket notifications

## **TIMING: 0:30 - 1:15 (45 seconds) - Backend Architecture Deep Dive**

### **What to Show:**
- Open backend folder structure
- Show API Gateway configuration (application.yml)
- Briefly show one service (booking-service) structure
- Show database schema/ER diagram

### **What to Say:**
"The backend follows Domain-Driven Design with clear separation of concerns. The API Gateway on port 8080 routes requests to appropriate microservices using load balancing. Each service runs on different ports - User Service handles authentication and user management, Booking Service manages service plans and bookings with Kafka messaging for asynchronous communication, Payment Service integrates with external payment gateways, and Notification Service uses MongoDB for real-time messaging. All services register with Eureka Server for service discovery and health monitoring."

### **Technical Points to Highlight:**
- Spring Cloud Gateway routing configuration
- Service registration with Eureka
- Database per service pattern
- Kafka for inter-service communication
- RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes

## **TIMING: 1:15 - 2:00 (45 seconds) - Frontend Architecture & Key Features**

### **What to Show:**
- Open Angular project structure
- Show key components (home, booking, admin dashboard)
- Show services folder (auth.service, booking.service)
- Show routing configuration

### **What to Say:**
"The Angular frontend implements a modular component-based architecture with lazy loading for optimal performance. It features role-based routing with guards, reactive forms with validation, and HTTP interceptors for JWT token management. The application includes responsive design with Angular Material, real-time notifications using WebSockets, and state management through services. Key modules include user authentication, service booking with payment integration, admin dashboard for managing washers and service plans, and a comprehensive review system."

### **Technical Points to Highlight:**
- Angular 17+ with standalone components
- Reactive forms and validation
- HTTP interceptors for authentication
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Angular Material for UI components

## **TIMING: 2:00 - 3:15 (75 seconds) - Live Application Demo**

### **What to Show & Say:**

#### **2:00 - 2:20 (20 seconds) - User Registration & Authentication**
- **Show:** Registration page, login with different roles
- **Say:** "The application supports OAuth integration and traditional email/password authentication. Users can register as customers or washers with profile picture upload and email verification."

#### **2:20 - 2:40 (20 seconds) - Customer Booking Flow**
- **Show:** Service selection, add-ons, scheduling, payment
- **Say:** "Customers can select from multiple wash packages, add extra services, schedule appointments, apply promo codes, and complete payments through integrated payment gateway with receipt generation."

#### **2:40 - 2:55 (15 seconds) - Washer Dashboard**
- **Show:** Washer accepting bookings, updating status
- **Say:** "Washers receive real-time booking notifications, can accept/reject bookings, update service status, and upload completion photos for customer verification."

#### **2:55 - 3:15 (20 seconds) - Admin Panel**
- **Show:** Admin managing users, service plans, analytics
- **Say:** "Admins have comprehensive control over user management, service plan configuration, promo code creation, and can view detailed analytics and booking reports."

## **TIMING: 3:15 - 4:00 (45 seconds) - Technical Implementation & Testing**

### **What to Show:**
- Code snippets of key implementations
- Test files (show the test file you have open)
- Database connections
- API testing (Postman or browser network tab)

### **What to Say:**
"The application implements comprehensive error handling, input validation, and security measures including SQL injection prevention and XSS protection. I've written extensive unit tests using JUnit and Mockito for backend services, and Jasmine/Karma for frontend components, achieving over 80% code coverage. The system includes proper logging, monitoring, and graceful error handling. Database transactions ensure data consistency, and the application is containerized with Docker for easy deployment. The notification system uses WebSockets for real-time updates, and the payment integration includes webhook handling for payment confirmations."

### **Technical Points to Highlight:**
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Security implementations (JWT, input validation)
- Error handling and logging
- Database transaction management
- Real-time communication with WebSockets
- Payment gateway integration with webhooks
